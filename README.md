# Multi Threading Assignment
This is simple project to demonstrate multi-threading.<br><br>
We have two java files, EvenOdd and ProducerConsumer.<br><br>
EvenOdd is a java program to print numbers from 0 to n where even numbers are printed using a seperate thread and odd numbers are printed using a seperate thread.<br>
I used synchronized method in the program.<br><br>
ProducerConsumer is a java program intended to demonstrate producer-consumer mechanism using Blocking Queue.<br><br><br>
